## ðŸ“Š Data & Analytics Tools
- **MySQL** â€“ Data extraction, transformation & management  
- **Power BI Desktop** â€“ Dashboard creation & data visualization  
- **Excel** â€“ Data preprocessing & organization  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** â€“ Advanced calculations & measures

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview  
NOTE: Imported the datasets from Mysql database ('trips_db' and 'targets_db') to PowerBI

This dataset consists of **dimension tables** (static data) and **fact tables** (transactional data). 
### ðŸ—‚ Dimension Tables (Reference Data)  
- **`dim_city`** â€“ City-specific details, enabling location-based analysis. 
- **`dim_date`** â€“ Date-specific details that enable time-based grouping and analysis, helping to identify patterns across days, months, and weekends versus weekdays..  
- **`dim_repeat_trip_distribution (Aggregated Data)`** â€“ provides a breakdown of repeat trip behavior, aggregated by month and city.
- **'city_target_passenger_rating'** - target average passenger rating that Goodcabs aims to achieve for each city, used to monitor customer satisfaction.

### ðŸ“Š Fact Tables (Transactional Data)  
- **`fact_passenger_summary (Aggregated Data)`** â€“ Aggregated summary of passenger counts for each city by month.
- **`fact_trips`** â€“ detailed information on each individual trip, including trip-specific metrics like distance, fare, and ratings, which can be used for granular trip-level analysis.
- **`monthly_target_new_passengers`** â€“ target number of new passengers Goodcabs aims to acquire in each city for the specified month, supporting growth tracking.
- **`monthly_target_trips`** - target number of total trips Goodcabs aims to achieve for each city and month, enabling assessment of trip volume performance.
